# NASA_Project
## Presentation
For our project we selected a set of data that contains some observational features of celestial objects. In the data we can find data related to the position of the celestial object, data related to the 5 bands of the telescope, data related to the variables of the camera and the image, data that identifies each object, and a column that classifies the object between star, quasar or galaxy.
The reason to select this topic is our interest in the universe and the different phenomenons that occur out there and we are not aware of.
The data was obatined from kaggle and it is distributed in three different files.
We want to explain how the data obtained on the 5 telescope bands is related to the final classification of the celestial object. We expect to be able to find the relationship between the telescope bands readings and the clasification of the object.

## Description of the Communication Protocols
In order to assure a succesful collaboration project we started by deciding in a meeeting what our project would be about. We decided based on a series of options which topic was more interesting for us; for which we could get a good amount of data to work with. Then we set the steps that we were going to take in order to accomplish our objective. Then we divided the job load by considering each team member strenghts. Then we set goals and dates for when each task was supposed to be accomplished by each member of the team. We also kept in communication on slack in order to help each other and to solve any issues encountered while programming.
